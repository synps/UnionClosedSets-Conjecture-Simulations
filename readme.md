# UnionClosedSets-Conjecture-Simulations

## **Simulations and Analysis for the Union-Closed Sets Conjecture**

This repository contains Python scripts designed to generate union-closed families, compute element frequencies and entropy, and visualize the results. The tools provided support empirical investigations into Franklâ€™s Union-Closed Sets Conjecture through multiple simulations and data analysis.

### **Key Features**

- **Union-Closed Family Generation:** Create union-closed set families with optional element biases.
- **Frequency and Entropy Analysis:** Calculate the frequency of element appearances and entropy metrics.
- **Visualization:** Generate network graphs and frequency distribution plots to illustrate simulation results.
- **Batch Simulations:** Execute multiple simulations to gather comprehensive empirical data.
- **Data Export:** Save results and summary statistics in CSV format for further analysis.
